# Flower-Classification-using-VGG19
Flower Classification using VGG19.  
There is 2 models, first one is fine-tunes FC1 and FC2.  
Second one is trains whole CNN.  
I could not run all ipynb file due to hardware limitations, as soon as I have better computer overall I will update it.  
Here is the dataset: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zhP3F6anZEmOkmZZOfXN_soSxdtkK2Rn/view?usp=sharing   
Seems like main folder name is "flowers15", I changed it to flowers only on my computer since I don't like the meaningless "15" addition.
